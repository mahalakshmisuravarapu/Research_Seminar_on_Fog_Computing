\section{Conclusion}

Fog computing is not a replacement but an extension of cloud computing. Computation, communication, and storage functionalities of cloud computing are extended to the edge of the network. Fog computing supports geographically distributed, latency-sensitive, and QoS-aware IoT applications. It has a huge potential to process time-sensitive service requests. Fog computing is the best alternative, but it does have some limitations. Application offloading, lack of resources, mobility, F-RANs, heterogeneity, and SDN-Based fog computing address challenges of fog computing. Fog computing can be applied to a wide range of next-generation network applications.
