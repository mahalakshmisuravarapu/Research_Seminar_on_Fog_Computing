abstract = {Fog Computing is a new variety of the cloud computing paradigm that brings virtualized cloud services to the edge of the network to control the devices in the IoT. We present a pattern for fog computing which describes its architecture, including its computing, storage and networking services. Fog computing is implemented as an intermediate platform between end devices and cloud computing data centers. The recent popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made fog computing a necessity to handle a variety of devices. It has been recognized as an important platform to provide efficient, location aware, close to the edge, cloud services. Our model includes most of the functionality found in current fog architectures.},
